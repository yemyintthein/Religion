        <h2>Introduction to Buddhism</h2>
        <p>Buddhism is a major world religion and philosophy founded in northeastern India in the 5th century BCE by Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha. It is based on his teachings and emphasizes the path to enlightenment through the practice of meditation, ethical conduct, and wisdom.</p>
        
        <h3>Beliefs and Practices</h3>
        <p>Buddhism centers on the Four Noble Truths: the truth of suffering (dukkha), the truth of the cause of suffering (samudaya), the truth of the end of suffering (nirodha), and the truth of the path leading to the end of suffering (magga). The path to the end of suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path, which includes right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.</p>
        <p>Buddhist practices include meditation, following ethical precepts, developing wisdom and understanding, and participating in rituals and ceremonies.</p>
        
        <h3>Major Branches</h3>
        <p>Buddhism has several major branches, including Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. Theravada is often referred to as the "Teaching of the Elders" and is prevalent in Southeast Asia. Mahayana, known as the "Great Vehicle," is practiced in East Asia. Vajrayana, or the "Diamond Vehicle," is associated with Tibetan Buddhism.</p>
        
        <h3>Buddhist Holidays</h3>
        <p>Some of the major Buddhist holidays include Vesak, which commemorates the birth, enlightenment, and death of the Buddha; Asalha Puja, which celebrates the Buddha's first sermon; and Magha Puja, which honors a significant event in the early Buddhist community. These holidays are celebrated with various rituals, ceremonies, and acts of devotion.</p>
