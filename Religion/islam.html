        <h2>Introduction to Islam</h2>
        <p>Islam is one of the world's major religions, with over 1.8 billion followers. It is based on the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, who Muslims believe is the final prophet sent by God. Islam emphasizes the worship of one God (Allah) and follows the teachings of the Quran, which Muslims believe to be the final revelation from God.</p>
        
        <h3>Beliefs and Practices</h3>
        <p>Muslims believe in the Five Pillars of Islam, which are the foundation of a Muslim's faith and practice. These pillars include the declaration of faith (Shahada), prayer (Salah), almsgiving (Zakat), fasting (Sawm) during the month of Ramadan, and the pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj) at least once in a lifetime for those who are able.</p>
        <p>In addition to the Five Pillars, Muslims follow the teachings of the Quran and the Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) in their daily lives.</p>
        
        <h3>Major Branches</h3>
        <p>Islam has two major branches: Sunni and Shia. Sunnis make up the majority of Muslims worldwide, while Shias are the largest minority. Both branches share core beliefs but have different practices and interpretations of Islamic teachings.</p>
        
        <h3>Islamic Holidays</h3>
        <p>Some of the major Islamic holidays include Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, and Eid al-Adha, which commemorates the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God. Other significant holidays include the Islamic New Year and the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad (Mawlid al-Nabi).</p>
