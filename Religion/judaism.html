        <h2>Introduction to Judaism</h2>
        <p>Judaism is one of the oldest monotheistic religions, with a history spanning over 3,000 years. It is based on the belief in one God and follows the teachings of the Hebrew Bible, also known as the Tanakh. Judaism emphasizes the covenant between God and the Jewish people, who are considered God's chosen people.</p>
        
        <h3>Beliefs and Practices</h3>
        <p>Central to Jewish belief is the concept of monotheism, the belief in a single, all-powerful God. Jewish practices include observing the Sabbath (Shabbat), keeping kosher dietary laws, daily prayer, and studying the Torah. The Torah, which includes the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, is considered the most important text in Judaism.</p>
        <p>Jewish practices also include life cycle events such as circumcision (brit milah), bar and bat mitzvah ceremonies, marriage, and mourning rituals.</p>
        
        <h3>Major Branches</h3>
        <p>Judaism has several major branches, including Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Judaism. Orthodox Judaism adheres strictly to traditional beliefs and practices, while Conservative Judaism takes a more moderate approach. Reform Judaism is the most liberal branch, advocating for adaptation and modernization of Jewish practices.</p>
        
        <h3>Jewish Holidays</h3>
        <p>Some of the major Jewish holidays include Passover (Pesach), which commemorates the Exodus from Egypt; Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year; Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement; Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights; and Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles. These holidays are celebrated with various rituals, prayers, and festive meals.</p>
